TO RUN THE FRONTEND :
1) open a terminal ( CTRL+` )
2) make sure u are in the frontend folder ( cd frontend )
3) start the frontend ( npm start )

TO RUN THE BACKEND : 
1) open a new terminal ( CTRL+` )
2) make sure u are in the backend folder ( cd backend )
3) start the backend ( nodemon server ) 

PS: use nodemon to run the server instead of node because nodemon will automatically
refresh the server when any change is applied to the code.
